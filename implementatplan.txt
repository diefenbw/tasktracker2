Implementation Plan



- prompt user to input a string to add a task



- allow user to input a task with a '?' to add the task without knowing if they

are sure about it



- Ask whether each task on the list is completed or not and then cross out

completed tasks without deleting them



- reorder the list once it cycles through all tasks
